### Engineering Project Proposal ###

**Purpose:** To build an end to end used car price application and help used car buyers/sellers to determine how much their cars worth based on the cars' features.

**Dataset:** Car sale price and features from cars.com will be scraped.  Sale price is the target, and features could be: car year, make, mileage per gallon, total mileage, drivetrain, fuel type, transmission, engine type, number of entertainment features, and number of safety features.

**Algorithms**

- Random forest Regressor will be used for modeling because it is able to handle any data type, requires no scaling, and has few hyperparameters to tune.

**Tools:**

- BeautifulSoup for scraping
- Pandas for data cleaning and EDA

- Matplotlib and seaborn for visualization

- SQL for data storage
- Google Colab and sklearn for model training 
- Flask for web application and model deployment

**MVP Goal:**

Scraped and cleaned the data and have the code ready in a reusable form.
